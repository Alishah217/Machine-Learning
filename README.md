# Machine-Learning
Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following strict rules, ML models learn from examples and improve their performance over time.

1. Types of Machine Learning
a. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs so it can make accurate predictions on new data.

🔹 Examples:

Classification: Spam email detection (Spam or Not Spam)
Regression: Predicting house prices based on size and location
b. Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the model is given data without labeled outputs. The goal is to find hidden patterns or structures within the data.

🔹 Examples:

Clustering: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior
Dimensionality Reduction: Compressing high-dimensional data into a simpler form
c. Reinforcement Learning
In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment and learns from rewards or penalties. The goal is to take actions that maximize long-term rewards.

🔹 Examples:

Training robots to walk
AI playing video games (like AlphaGo)
2. Key Concepts in Machine Learning
a. Features and Labels
Features: Input variables (e.g., age, height, income)
Labels: Output or target variable (e.g., "disease present" or "not present")
b. Model Training & Testing
Training: The model learns from data
Testing: Evaluating the model on unseen data
c. Overfitting & Underfitting
Overfitting: The model memorizes the training data but performs poorly on new data
Underfitting: The model is too simple and fails to learn patterns
3. Popular Machine Learning Algorithms
🔹 Linear Regression – Used for predicting continuous values
🔹 Decision Trees – Used for classification and regression
🔹 Random Forest – An ensemble of decision trees for better accuracy
🔹 Neural Networks – Mimics the human brain for deep learning tasks
🔹 K-Means Clustering – Groups similar data points together

4. Applications of Machine Learning
✅ Healthcare – Disease detection, medical diagnosis
✅ Finance – Fraud detection, stock market predictions
✅ E-Commerce – Product recommendations, customer segmentation
✅ Self-Driving Cars – Object recognition, path planning
✅ Content Creation – Video recommendations, automatic captions
